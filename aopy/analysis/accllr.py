    Accumulated log likelihood for single channel LFP data.
    
    Note: 
        As quoted from Banerjee et al. (2010), the common_variance parameter should
        be set to True:
        "Since AccLLR changes for LFP activity are scaled by the noise variance for 
        each condition, if the noise variances for each condition differ, the AccLLRs 
        scale differently and this leads to the need for different upper and lower 
        bounds at the discrimination stage. To allow the simplicity of using the same 
        bound for both conditions (see the following subsection), we assume that the 
        variance of activity under each condition is the same."
        
    Note:
        Unsure whether the lowpass filtered version of the lfp should be used in 
        place of the lfp entirely. That is how the Pesaran lab code works, however
        it doesn't seem to make sense to throw away the raw lfp, so here I use
        the lowpass filtered version for the mean estimate across trials but use 
        the raw lfp for single trials.
        
    Note:
        Finally, there is a difference between how the cumulative sum is calculated
        here versus in the Pesaran lab code. Here we include the first value of
        the LLR as the first value of the accLLR. However, the Pesaran lab truncates
        the accLLR so that it starts at the second sum.

    Calculate accllr selection time for a multiple channels with optional selectivity
    matching. Selectivity is defined by the area under the ROC curve. To match 
    selectivity, we add gaussian noise to channel until selectivity is constant 
    across all channels.

    Based on the paper:

    Banerjee A, Dean HL, Pesaran B. A likelihood method for computing selection times 
    in spiking and local field potential activity. J Neurophysiol. 2010 Dec;104(6):3705-20. 
    doi: 10.1152/jn.00036.2010. Epub 2010 Sep 8. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20884767/

    Note: 
        No noise is added to the models built on the lowpass versions of data. It is unclear how
        this step was performed in the original paper.

    Examples:

        Below are powers in 50-250hz band of three channels of laser-evoked response in motor cortex, 
        aligned to laser onset across 350 trials, 50 ms before and after. We first apply AccLLR without
        selectivity matching:

        .. code-block:: python

            st, roc_auc, roc_se, roc_p_fdrc = accllr.calc_accllr_st(altcond, nullcond, altcond, 
                                                                    nullcond, 'lfp', 1./samplerate)
            accllr_mean = np.nanmean(st, axis=1)

        .. image:: _images/accllr_test_data.png

        The dotted lines are the estimated selection times returned by accllr. Note that the bigger
        responses have faster selection times -- to test whether the estimates are biased by the 
        larger peaks being easier to identify, we can add noise until they match the selectivity of
        the smaller peak. Selectivity is defined by ROC analysis -- our ability to discriminate 
        between laser event trials and null trials.
    
        .. image:: _images/accllr_test_data_match_selectivity.png

        Note that the selection times for the two larger peaks have shifted slightly to the right,
        but are still earlier than the smaller peak, despite having the same (or lower) selectivity.
        Thus, we can be confident that the bigger peaks appear faster than the smaller one.

        data_altcond ((nt, nch, ntrial)): lfp channel data for trials from the alternative condition
        data_nullcond ((nt, nch, ntrial)): lfp channel data for trials from the null condition
        lowpass_altcond ((nt, nch, ntrial) array): low-pass filtered copy of alternative condition trials. If
            desired, just pass the lfp_altcond again to avoid using a low-pass filtered version for model building.
        lowpass_nullcond ((nt, nch, ntrial) array): low-pass filtered copy of null condition trials
        modality (str): type of data being inputted ("lfp", "spikes", etc.)
        bin_width (float): bin width of input activity, or 1./samplerate for lfp data
        nlevels (int): number of levels at which to test accllr performance
        match_selectivity (bool, optional): if True, add noise to input data to match selectivity across channels.
            Default False.
        match_ch ((nch,) bool array or None, optional): if set, limit selectivity matching to only these 
            channels. Default None.

            Default 1.
